# dojo.require('parser'); for an asp.net mvc 2 project

Dojo Require Parser provides a way to create a module that represents all of your unique dojo.require statements.

* This is really helpful for creating layer files

You can simply declare core.requires as a dependency in your build profile.

The code is pretty straight forward and currently is looking at 'aspx' pages and 'ascx' user controls.

It's not very generic so modify to suite your needs.
